Neural Networks for Early Prediction of Sepsis
Author: David Snyder
MLCD Dec 20th 2013

Note: you will not be able to run any of the sepsis related scripts.
It is impractical to include all 12 gigs of heart rate data in this
submission which the scripts rely on. 
Also, I do not feel at liberty to submit medical data in a 
homework assignment or submit it to github. Please note that I am 
happy to provide an in person demo on my filesystem, if there is any 
doubt that this works as reported. 

However, I have included a WORKING DEMO, which you can run by
typing
    python density_demo.py
in this directory. This demonstrates a neural network learning
a mapping called the Density Classification and then subsequently
being tested on a dev/validation set. This is a 5-bit density
classification task, and so the network has 5 inputs. There are 
100 nodes in the hidden layer. This network should achieve an 
accuracy of about 15% on the dev/validation set.

Files included in this submission:

  README ..................... This file

  mlp.py ..................... The Multilayer Perceptron class

  density_demo.py ............ The density demo

  density_dev.txt ............ Dev/validation set for the demo

  density_train.txt .......... Training set for the demo

  make_averaged_data.py ...... A script for generating 1 minute features 
                               from the original 2 Hz heartrate

  make_training_stats.py ..... A script for calculating statistics on the
                               features above. This is needed to normalize
                               the input to the network.

  sepsis_heartrate_test.py ... The main script for experimenting with 
                               neural network sepsis prediction using 
                               heart rate.
